/// Feature type
/// Various types of administrative units are available via the Search Box API. Any type might appear as a top-level response, as context in a top-level response, or as a filtering option using the optional `types` parameter.
/// This hierarchy of feature types is also used to determine what will be returned as the encompassing parent features in a Geocoding API response object's `context` property.
/// For example, if the returned feature is a `place` (like Detroit), then the encompassing parent features in the context property will be the `region` (the state of Michigan) and the `country` (United States).
/// The full spatial hierarchy, ordered from the most granular to the largest, is: point of interest (POI), address, neighborhood, locality, postcode, place, district, region, and country.
/// The geographic feature types listed from the largest to the most granular.

/// SearchBoxSuggestRequest: country, region,                   postcode, district, place, city, locality, neighborhood, street, address, poi, category
